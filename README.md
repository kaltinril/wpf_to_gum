# Overview

The purpose of this repository was for me to learn GUM by following a WPF tutorial to see how close they relate.

GUM documentation can be found here: https://docs.flatredball.com/gum

The simple tutorial I tried to mimic was here: https://wpf-tutorial.com/xaml/basic-xaml/

# History
This project morphed over time into a testing ground and test suite to validate changes after Vic and I made updates to Gum Code only.

Then we built V2 visuals, and I wanted to see a side-by-side comparison so I made a 2nd solution.

Then Vic renamed and moved objects around in namespaces, and I wanted to have a project that worked with that.

So now there are 3 "solutions" all basically the same.

# Where to start?

If you are on the latest gum, you probably want to use the wpf_to_gum_visual2_namespaces solution.

This is linked to source which means you have to have the GUM code checked out too.

This is the folder structure for your repo checkouts
...your-folder\
  -> gum
  -> wpf_to_gum

This is just a test suite, use whatever you want from it.
